# How to contribute

## Improve Documentation

We are always looking to improve our documentation.
If at some point you are reading the documentation and something is not clear, or you cannot find what you are looking for, then please open an [issue](https://github.com/secondstreet/ember-material-components-web/issues).
This gives us a chance to answer your question and to improve the documentation if needed.

Pull requests correcting spelling or grammar mistakes are always welcome.

We are currently tracking our documentation needs in [Issue #10](https://github.com/secondstreet/ember-material-components-web/issues/10), which is a meta-issue that tracks all of our documentation issues.

## Found a bug?

Please try to answer at least the following questions when reporting a bug:

- Which version of the project did you use when you noticed the bug?

  You'll find this in your `package.json`'s `devDependencies` as `ember-material-components-web`.
  
- How do you reproduce the error condition?

- What happened that you think is a bug?

- What should it do instead?

## Have a feature request?

Please provide some thoughtful commentary and code samples on what this feature should do, and why it should be added (your use case).
The minimal questions you should answer when submitting a feature request should be:

- What will it allow you to do that you can't do today?
